    title: 'Rising Global Temperatures',
    category: 'climate',
    shortDesc: 'Earth\'s average temperature has increased significantly.',
    fullDesc: 'Since the late 19th century, Earth\'s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.1°C (2°F), primarily due to increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions. The majority of warming has occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. This warming affects weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems worldwide.',

    title: 'Deforestation Crisis',
    category: 'nature',
    shortDesc: 'Forests are disappearing at an alarming rate.',
    fullDesc: 'Approximately 10 million hectares of forest are lost each year. Forests are vital carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. They also provide habitat for 80% of terrestrial species and are home to indigenous communities. Deforestation contributes to climate change, biodiversity loss, and soil erosion.',

    title: 'Ocean Plastic Pollution',
    category: 'pollution',
    shortDesc: 'Oceans are filled with plastic waste.',
    fullDesc: 'Over 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans every year. This plastic breaks down into microplastics that are consumed by marine life, entering the food chain. Plastic pollution harms over 700 marine species through ingestion and entanglement. By 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by weight if current trends continue.',

    title: 'Biodiversity Loss',
    category: 'nature',
    shortDesc: 'Species are disappearing faster than ever.',
    fullDesc: 'We are experiencing the sixth mass extinction event, with species disappearing at 1,000 to 10,000 times the natural rate. Over 1 million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction. This loss affects ecosystem services like pollination, water purification, and climate regulation that humans depend on.',

    title: 'Renewable Energy Growth',
    category: 'climate',
    shortDesc: 'Clean energy is expanding worldwide.',
    fullDesc: 'Renewable energy capacity is growing rapidly, with solar and wind leading the way. In 2022, renewables accounted for 30% of global electricity generation. The cost of solar panels has dropped by 90% since 2010, making clean energy more accessible. Transitioning to renewables is key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.',

    title: 'Air Quality Impact',
    category: 'pollution',
    shortDesc: 'Air pollution affects billions of people.',
    fullDesc: 'Air pollution causes 7 million premature deaths annually worldwide. Major pollutants include particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone from vehicles, industry, and agriculture. Poor air quality affects respiratory and cardiovascular health, with children and elderly most vulnerable. Reducing emissions and increasing green spaces can improve air quality.',

    title: 'Coral Reef Bleaching',
    category: 'nature',
    shortDesc: 'Warming oceans threaten coral ecosystems.',
    fullDesc: 'Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae they depend on for food. About 50% of the world\'s coral reefs have been lost in the last 30 years. Coral reefs support 25% of marine life despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. They also protect coastlines and support fisheries that feed millions.',

    title: 'Food Waste Problem',
    category: 'pollution',
    shortDesc: 'A third of food produced is wasted.',
    fullDesc: 'Approximately 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally each year, about one-third of all food produced. This waste occurs throughout the supply chain, from farms to households. Food waste in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Reducing food waste can help feed the hungry, save resources, and reduce emissions.',

    title: 'Bee Population Decline',
    category: 'nature',
    shortDesc: 'Pollinators are essential but disappearing.',
    fullDesc: 'Bee populations have been declining due to habitat loss, pesticides, disease, and climate change. Bees pollinate 75% of global food crops and 90% of wild flowering plants. Without pollinators, many fruits, vegetables, and nuts would become scarce. Protecting bee habitats and reducing pesticide use are critical for food security.',
